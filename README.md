This is a readme for my first project.

This project features a ninja character in Javascript that is controllable with the arrow keys.  The character alternates steps so it looks like the character is walking as it is being controlled by the user.  There are boundaries placed in the program so that the character does not move past a certain point.  

Opportunities for refactoring: This program uses an if-else if set for every single arrow key, but it could only be used once at the end of function(e) to cover all four arrows.
